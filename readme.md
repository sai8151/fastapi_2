Here are the `curl` commands for testing the FastAPI endpoints for your notes application. You can use these commands to perform CRUD operations via HTTP requests:

### 1. **Create a Note**

**POST Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/notes/" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "Test Note", "content": "This is a test note"}'
```

### 2. **Read All Notes**

**GET Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/notes/"
```

### 3. **Read a Specific Note by ID**

**GET Request:**

Replace `{note_id}` with the ID of the note you want to read.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/notes/{note_id}"
```

### 4. **Update a Note**

**PUT Request:**

Replace `{note_id}` with the ID of the note you want to update.

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/notes/{note_id}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "Updated Note", "content": "Updated content"}'
```

### 5. **Delete a Note**

**DELETE Request:**

Replace `{note_id}` with the ID of the note you want to delete.

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/notes/{note_id}"
```

### Explanation of Each Command

1. **Create a Note**:
   - `-X POST`: Specifies the HTTP method (POST).
   - `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Sets the content type of the request to JSON.
   - `-d '{"title": "Test Note", "content": "This is a test note"}'`: Provides the data for the note to be created.

2. **Read All Notes**:
   - `-X GET`: Specifies the HTTP method (GET). No additional data is needed for this request.

3. **Read a Specific Note by ID**:
   - Replace `{note_id}` with the actual ID of the note you want to retrieve. This fetches a specific note by its ID.

4. **Update a Note**:
   - `-X PUT`: Specifies the HTTP method (PUT).
   - `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Sets the content type to JSON.
   - `-d '{"title": "Updated Note", "content": "Updated content"}'`: Provides the updated data for the note.

5. **Delete a Note**:
   - `-X DELETE`: Specifies the HTTP method (DELETE). No additional data is needed for this request.

Replace `http://localhost:8000` with the appropriate URL if your FastAPI application is running on a different host or port.
